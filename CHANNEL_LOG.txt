3621 - COMMIT
    2024-10-15:
        I altered the flake.nix 'nixosConfiguration' attribute to be more 
        accommodating for adding future keys like "laptop" or "macos". 

1892 - COMMIT
    2024-10-15:
        I moved the flake.nix and flake.lock to the root of the repository. I 
        was unable to rebuild remotely using those files in the nixos directory.
        I also added this channelog. I modified the README.md to see if I was 
        able to rebuild if the branch was dirty. I think I was, but faced a 
        significant problem when trying to rebuild after moving the flake files.
        This commit will test if I am able to rebuild after pushing a commit.

163 - INITIAL
    2024-10-15:
        The initial commit for this nix repository. The aim of this
        repository is to aggregate my nix-related configurations into a unified
        structure. I will continue to alter, fix, and build upon these 
        configurations. This is the channelog of such efforts. This commit only
        contained the initial README.md and LICENSE files.
